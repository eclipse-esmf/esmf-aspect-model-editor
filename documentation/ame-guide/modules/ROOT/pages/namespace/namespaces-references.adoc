[[namespaces-references]]
= Namespaces and references

The Aspect Model Editor supports references and custom namespaces. The namespaces from which the external elements can be referenced are defined by the folder structure of the Aspect Model Editor file directory.



[[namespace-view]]
== Namespaces view in the Aspect Model Editor

In the Aspect Model Editor, to view a list of namespaces and files associated to the namespaces, click the Workspace icon image:elements/workspace.png[Workspace icon, 3%].

The short menu of actions is available via the *...* icon that appears when you hover over an Aspect Model.
