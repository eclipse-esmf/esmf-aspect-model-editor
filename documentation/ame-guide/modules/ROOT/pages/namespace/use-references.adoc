[NOTE]
====
References can only be dragged once into the current Aspect Model. These elements are marked with a special icon signifying that they are from a different location. You can only edit an reference by editing the file it is defined in. By double clicking an reference the file where that element exists will be opened in a different window

[NOTE]
====
When you drag and drop an reference, it will not include all the lower connections (dependencies) of the element.

Referenced elements displayed in Aspect Model Editor should never have outgoing references.
Reason: models can have many referenced elements from many files. these referenced elements can have multiple references, and to check every pair of referenced elements for whether they refer to each other or not is not feasible.

→ An reference has now been added to your model.

[[refer-to-another-element]]
== Refer from one element to another one

To refer from one element to another one, proceed as follows:

. xref:getting-started/load-and-save-models.adoc#save-models[Save] the model you are currently working on.
. xref:getting-started/load-and-save-models.adoc#load-start-new-models[Load] the model that you intend to reference to.
+
→  Now the reference can be found in the xref:getting-started/ui-overview.adoc#workspace-sidebar[Workspace sidebar].
. xref:getting-started/load-and-save-models.adoc#load-start-new-models[Load or start] a new model.
. xref:namespace/import-package.adoc[].
. Double-click the TTL file of which you want to use elements from.
. Drag the specific element and drop it on the graph area canvas.

→ An reference has now been added to your model.
