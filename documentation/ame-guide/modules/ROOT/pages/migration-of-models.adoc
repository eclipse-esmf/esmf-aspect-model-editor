[[migration-of-models]]
= Migration of models

There are three different ways to migrate an Aspect Model:

* Automatic migration when starting the application.
* Initiate migration from the sidebar.
* Loading a (syntactically valid) Aspect Model based on an older SAMM version

[[automatic-migration]]
== Automatic migration when starting the application

As soon as the application is started and an Aspect Model with an older version is found in the workspace.
A dialog appears with the information whether the Aspect Models should be migrated.

* If the checkbox Auto-increase namespace versions is activated, the Aspect Models are updated to the next higher version and the old Aspect Models are no longer displayed in the workspace.

* If the checkbox Auto-increase namespace versions is not activated, the Aspect Models will be overwritten without the version of the Aspect Models increasing.

NOTE: A backup of the old Aspect Models will be created in the workspace as a zip package.

After the migration has been completed, the Aspect models can be modelled as usually.

[[initiate-migration-from-the-sidebar]]
== Initiate migration from the sidebar

If the migration of the Aspect Models in the workspace is to be carried out later, this can be cancelled for the first time.
A migration button is provided in the sidebar below ((/within?)) the workspace to start a pending migration.

[[loading-old-model]]
== Loading a (syntactically valid) Aspect Model based on an older SAMM version

A migration of an Aspect Model in an old version can also be loaded as usual.
The tool automatically recognises the older version and migrates it to the latest SAMM version.
