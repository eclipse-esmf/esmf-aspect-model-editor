[[migration-of-models]]
= Migration of models

There are three different ways to migrate an Aspect Model:

* Automatic migration when starting the application.
* Loading a (syntactically valid) Aspect Model based on an older meta model version

[[automatic-migration]]
== Automatic migration when starting the application

As soon as the application is started and an Aspect Model with an older version is found in the workspace.
The migration from a BAMM 2.0.0-based Aspect Model is automatically migrated to the latest SAMM version.

[[loading-old-model]]
== Loading a (syntactically valid) Aspect Model based on an older version

A migration of an Aspect Model in an old version can also be loaded as usual.
The tool automatically recognises the older version and migrates it to the latest SAMM version.
