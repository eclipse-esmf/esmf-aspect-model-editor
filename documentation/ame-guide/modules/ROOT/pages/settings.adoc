Define for which languages the `description` and the `preferredName` attributes for elements should be displayed.

Element attributes can only be added for the languages defined in your settings.

NOTE: Importing a model automatically imports all languages existing in the respective model but never deletes a language.

WARNING: All attributes of each element in a specific language will be deleted without a way to restore them, when deleting this language from your settings.
Make sure to save your model before deleting languages in your settings.
