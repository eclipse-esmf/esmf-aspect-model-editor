[[load-and-save-models]]
= Load and save models

The Aspect Model Editor supports loading and saving Aspect Models in the official RDF/Turtle format (TTL).

NOTE: In case the loaded Aspect Model has a lower SAMM version than the one that the Aspect Model Editor is currently based on, migration will start automatically.

Currently, the Aspect Model Editor is based on https://openmanufacturingplatform.github.io/sds-bamm-aspect-meta-model/bamm-specification/2.0.0[SAMM Aspect Meta Model 2.0.0^,opts=nofollow].
