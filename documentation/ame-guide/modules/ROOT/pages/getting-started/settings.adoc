Define for which languages the `description` and the `preferredName` attributes for elements should be displayed.

Element attributes can only be added for the languages defined in your settings.

For each language defined in the settings you will later get an entry field, as shown in the example property.

NOTE: Importing a model automatically imports all languages existing in the respective model but never deletes a language.

WARNING: All attributes of each element in a specific language will be deleted without a way to restore them, when deleting this language from your settings.
Make sure to save your model before deleting languages in your settings.
