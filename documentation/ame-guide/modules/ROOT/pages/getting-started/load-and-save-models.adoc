= Load and save models

The Aspect Model Editor supports loading and saving Aspect Models in the official RDF/Turtle format (TTL).

NOTE: In case the loaded Aspect Model has a lower SAMM version than the one that the Aspect Model Editor is currently based on, migration will start automatically.

Currently, the Aspect Model Editor is based on https://eclipse-esmf.github.io/samm-specification/2.1.0/index.html[SAMM Aspect Meta Model 2.1.0^,opts=nofollow].
