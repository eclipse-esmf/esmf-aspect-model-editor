= Shared Models

NOTE: One can opt to delete the Aspect from the model, thereby allowing the creation of aspect models that do not necessarily have aspects.
This can prove advantageous, particularly when developing broadly defined elements for use in various aspect models.

If you need to delete an Aspect element, you can choose a new file name to describe the Shared Model that will result from the deletion.
This file can then be saved in the workspace like any other file.

When using the Shared Model, the process is the same as with external references, as seen in xref:use-external-references.adoc[Use external references].
