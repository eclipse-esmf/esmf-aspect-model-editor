This section guides you through your first steps with the Aspect Model Editor for creating, editing, and saving an Aspect Model.

For more information on the underlying specification, see https://eclipse-esmf.github.io/samm-specification/2.0.0/index.html[SAMM Aspect Meta Model version 2.0.0^,opts=nofollow].

NOTE: The Aspect Model Editor does currently not support shortcuts for editing Aspect Models.
Please use the icons and buttons as provided in the user interface (e.g., xref::ui-overview.adoc#toolbar[toolbar], xref::ui-overview.adoc#add-icon[Add icon] as well as right click for context menu).
All elements of the user interface are described in the xref:ui-overview.adoc[UI Overview] section.
