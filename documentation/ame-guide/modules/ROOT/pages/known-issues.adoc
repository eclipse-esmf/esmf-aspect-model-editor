[[issues-with-validation-loading-ttl-files]]
== Issues with validating, loading, and saving Aspect Models (TTL files)

[[aspect-model-editor-freezes-loading-model]]
=== Aspect Model Editor freezes when loading model

[%noheader,cols="15%,85%"]
|===
h| Error
a| When loading an Aspect Model, the Aspect Model Editor freezes in a blurry mode.

h| Explanation
a| This can be caused by previously generated TTL with certain syntax errors. This can be caused by renaming an Entity.
|===

[[error-when-loading-rdf]]
=== Error when loading RDF

[%noheader,cols="15%,85%"]
|===
h| Error
a| When loading a TTL file to edit an Aspect Model, an `Error when loading RDF` is shown.

h| Explanation
a| This is caused by fundamental syntax errors in the TTL being loaded. Potential underlying root cause: The used BAMM
version is not supported by this version of the Aspect Model Editor.

h| Workaround
a|
Check that you have not missed parts of the TTL file. Also check against syntax errors consulting https://openmanufacturingplatform.github.io/sds-bamm-aspect-meta-model/bamm-specification/2.0.0/namespaces.html[Namespaces and versions (BAMM 2.0.0)^,opts=nofollow].
|===

[[datatype-characteristic]]
=== The dataType (see value) that is used as dataType on the Characteristic (see focusNode) is neither an allowed XSD or RDF type, nor a type that is defined as rdfs:Class.

[%noheader,cols="15%,85%"]
|===
h| Error
a|
"resultMessage":"The dataType (see value) that is used as dataType on the Characteristic (see focusNode) is neither an allowed XSD or RDF type nor a type that is defined as rdfs:Class."

"focusNode":"urn:bamm:com.your.example.namespace:aspect-model:AngularVelocityHistory:1.1.1#AngularVelocityTimeSeries"

"resultPath":"urn:bamm:com.your.example.namespace:meta-model:1.2.0#dataType" "resultSeverity":"http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#Violation"

"value":"urn:bamm:com.your.example.namespace:aspect-model:AngularVelocityHistory:1.1.1#AngularVelocityTimeSeriesEntity"

h| Explanation
a| This can happen if a namespace version is not supported anymore or when setting an unsupported dataType.

h| Workaround
a|
_Wrong data type_

Check that the data types you are using are correct, see
https://openmanufacturingplatform.github.io/sds-bamm-aspect-meta-model/bamm-specification/2.0.0/datatypes.html[Datatypes (BAMM 2.0.0)^,opts=nofollow]

_Unsupported Namespaces_

Check that your currently used namespaces in the TTL file are up to date.

Hint: You can check the current default namespaces via looking at the Movement Example code. Display the Movement Example by clicking the New/Load icon > Create/Upload Aspect Model > Models > Movement Example.

[[validation-does-not-stop]]
=== Validation does not stop

[%noheader,cols="15%,85%"]
|===
h| Error
a| When loading a TTL file, units are not loaded correctly. After triggering a validation, this validation does not stop and the user cannot continue to edit the Aspect Model.

h| Explanation
a|
The backend validation does not complete successfully. One reason can be that the backend service is not running.

h| Workaround
a|
Restart the Aspect Model Editor.

Fixed for Aspect Model Editor 2.1.0 and higher: If the backend is not available, a message is shown to the user.
|===

[[validation-timeout]]
=== Validation timeout

[%noheader,cols="15%,85%"]
|===
h| Error
a| After triggering a validation, the validation runs into a timeout.

h| Explanation
a| The backend validation does not complete successfully. One reason can be that the backend service is not running.

h| Workaround
a| Restart the Aspect Model Editor.
|===

[[editing-element]]
=== Editing elements

[%noheader,cols="15%,85%"]
|===
h| Error
a| While the element edit view is displayed and you adjust something in the editor, the edit view is not updated.

h| Workaround
a| Close the edit elements view and reopen it.
|===

[[overlapping-elements]]
=== Overlapping elements

[%noheader,cols="15%,85%"]
|===
h| Error
a| As soon as elements overlap, the last created one is displayed above all others.

h| Workaround
a| Move all elements to a free space so that you can see them again.
|===

[[other-known-issues]]
== Other known issues

[[launch-windows-application-twice]]
=== Launch Windows application twice

[%noheader,cols="15%,85%"]
|===
h| Error
a| If the application is started twice, there may be problems with some Aspect Models already displayed in the other application.

h| Explanation
a| Electron/Windows locks these files and recognizes that they are already used by another tool.

h| Workaround
a| Launch only one instance of the Aspect Model Editor.
|===

[[aspect-model-editor-installation-cannot-write-all-files]]
=== Aspect Model Editor installation cannot write all files

[%noheader,cols="15%,85%"]
|===
h| Error
a| During installation, some files cannot be written. Popup allows retry or abort.

h| Explanation
a| File path restriction does not allow writing a file.

h| Workaround
a| Install on C:\AME or similar without going deeper in hierarchy.
|===

[[cannot-add-entity-relate-entity-with-characteristic]]
=== Cannot add Entity or relate Entity with Characteristic

[%noheader,cols="15%,85%"]
|===
h| Error
a| Trying to add entity / relate entity with Characteristic does not work.

h| Explanation
a| This is the intended behavior. If your Characteristic is a predefined instance, its data type is immutable. In this case you cannot relate it with an Entity.

h| Workaround
a| Should you need to relate this Characteristic with an Entity, change your Characteristic class first and modify your own Entity as suitable.
|===

[[key-press-not-recognized]]
=== Key press not recognized

[%noheader,cols="15%,85%"]
|===
h| Error
a| During usage, a key press (e.g. delete to delete an element) is not recognized. Instead, no action happens.

h| Explanation
a| The Aspect Model Editor does not support keystrokes like "del". See xref:get-started.adoc[Get started].

h| Workaround
a| Use mouse actions instead, e.g. the toolbar on the top with the Delete icon. You can also change your focus back and forth to try again pressing the delete key.
|===

[[elements-missing-auto-format]]
=== Some elements seem missing when loading or auto-formatting

[%noheader,cols="15%,85%"]
|===
h| Error
a| After loading an Aspect Model or after auto-format, some elements seem to be missing

h| Explanation
a|
Elements may in some cases be moved on top of each other or far away. This can for example happen when there are elements in the Aspect Model that are not connected to the Aspect (directly or via other elements)


h| Workaround
a|
* It is the preferred working style to keep all elements connected to the Aspect (i.e. avoiding the use of "isolated elements")
* Use dragging an element or auto-format to find if another element is hidden below it
* Use search to search and focus an element
* Use zoom or fit to screen or map preview to detect elements that may be far away
|===

[[uninstaller-not-available]]
=== Uninstaller not available

[%noheader,cols="15%,85%"]
|===
h| Error
a|
The "Aspect Model Editor Uninstaller" is not available when searching via Windows search bar, see

image::uninstall-error.png[width=50%]

h| Explanation
a| Unknown root cause.

h| Workaround
a|

Uninstall via context menu which will lead to add/remove programs

[[javascript-mac-ame3.0.0]]
=== MacOS: JavaScript error occurred in the main process

[%noheader,cols="15%,85%"]
|===
h| Error
a|
Error message when starting the Aspect Model Editor on MacOS.

h| Explanation
a|
If your MacOS version is running Apple's new security feature, it could happen that the application is started in a kind of sandbox. You can easily detect this by reading the following in the JavaScript error message: `Uncaught Exception: Error: spawn /private/var...` (see image below).

image::error-mac-javascript-main-process.png[width=50%]

h| Workaround
a|
The keyword here is `/private/var`, which means that your application is in a kind of quarantine and can only be unlocked by you. For this you must open your terminal and execute the following command:

`xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/AspectModelEditor/Aspect-Model-Editor.app`

Please note that the path to the application can change and this is only the default path.

Please keep in mind that this is not an official Apple version, and it must be confirmed in the security settings first. You may be asked several times before the app opens.

If your security settings are enabled to launch unverified applications, the following error messages may pop up. These must be pre-approved in the security settings of your system.

image::error-mac-javascript-main-process-approval.png[width=70%]

The following should be considered when approving:

* Error messages must not be closed.
* Go to System Preferences and click on Security & Privacy.
* Open the General tab and click on the small padlock at the left bottom corner to make changes.
* Enter your admin password.
* Close messages and restart the Aspect Model Editor.
