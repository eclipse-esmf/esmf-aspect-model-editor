== Add Entity instances to complex data types

To add an Entity instance as a complex value data type for an Enumeration Characteristic, proceed as follows:

. Click the Add button at the data type attribute field.

. In the displayed dialog, enter the Entity instance name and the values of its properties.

. Click *Save*.

→ Now the Enumeration Characteristics Edit dialog displays a table with the information you just entered.

Now you can also create Entity instances using the Add icon image:add.png[Add icon] at the Enumeration Characteristic element in the Aspect Model.
Note that first an Entity had to be created before an instance can be added.

== Add nested Entity instances

The properties of the Entity instance described above had simple values.
However, they can also have complex values.
To achieve that, use nested Entity instances.

NOTE: Nested instances can only be created once the model allows it.
It is important to construct your model first and then create the instances.

To create a nested Entity instance, proceed as follows:

. Double-click on an existing Entity instance element to show its attributes in the xref:modeling/edit-elements.adoc#edit-elements-general[Edit dialog].
+

. Start typing a new Entity instance name and then select it from the drop-down menu.
+
Note that complex values have an icon that identifies them, i.e., a new Entity instance should be created here.
Once created, the attribute field is read-only and you can only remove a nested Entity instance with the Delete icon if another Entity instance is to be created or used for it.
+

. Click *Save*.
+
image::save-nested-entity-instance.png[width=80%]

→ Now the new nested Entity instance is related as a property value to the overarching Entity instance.
