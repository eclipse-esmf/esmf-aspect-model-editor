The elements of an Aspect Model &ndash; such as Properties, Operations, Characteristics, Constraints, Entities, or Events &ndash;
can be distributed over the complete editor main canvas.

. Click both elements while holding the CTRL key on your keyboard.
. Click the *Connect* icon in the xref:getting-started/ui-overview.adoc#toolbar[toolbar].

â†’ Both elements are now connected.

* If only one direction is permitted, the arrow will be set respectively.
* If both directions are permitted, the arrow will be set for the element selected first to the element selected second.
* Tf a connection is not permitted, a respective warning will appear and the elements will not be connected.

TIP: Alternatively, you can use the context menu (right mouse click) to access the action items.

The larger the diagram, the harder it might get elements that are fare away.

In case you cannot connect two elements just the way you are most familiar with, try one of these procedures.

== Connect via context menu

* Click the source element.
* Right-click to access the context menu.
* Select *connect with ...*.
* The new pop-up displays all the elements of the model. +
  In case there are too element many type the name in the search field.
* Select the target element.
* Click *Connect* to confirm.

Upon success the arrow is visible.
In case you try to connect elements which cannot be connected, a validation notification will inform you respectively.

== Connect via focus

* Single click the first element - this sets focus on element
