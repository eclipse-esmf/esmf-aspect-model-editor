There are two different ways to create an abstract property:

* Use drag-and-drop from the Workspace sidebar.
* Click the add icon on an Abstract Entity.

== Use drag-and-drop from the Workspace sidebar

To add abstract property, proceed as follows:

. Open the Workspace sidebar.
. Drag the abstract property element and drop it to the graph area canvas.

[[abstract-property-example]]
== Abstract Properties Example

When an Entity connects to an Abstract Entity with Abstract Properties, a Property is created for each non-optional Abstract Property.
Each Property created extends one Abstract Property and is connected to the Entity.
The Property that inherits an Abstract Property gets the same name as the Abstract Property and inherits all field information from Abstract Property.
Data from the derived Property cannot be edited and is greyed out in the edit dialog.
