[[abstract-property-example]]
== Abstract Properties Example

When an Entity connects to an Abstract Entity with Abstract Properties, for each non-optional Abstract Property, a Property is created.
Each Property created extends one Abstract Property and is connected to the Entity.
The Property that inherits an Abstract Property gets the same name as the Abstract Property and inherits all field information from Abstract Property.
Data from derived Property cannot be edited and is greyed out in the edit dialog.
