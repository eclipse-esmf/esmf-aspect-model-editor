== Constraint attributes

Constraints are special Characteristics that can restrict some features of the Characteristics.
A list of the available Constraints can be found in the https://eclipse-esmf.github.io/samm-specification/2.0.0/characteristics.html[SAMM Aspect Meta Model version 1.0.0.^,opts=nofollow].

Except for Length Constraint, Range Constraint, and Fixed Point Constraint, all other Constraint types use `string` as a defined Constraint value.

For example, the Range Constraint uses minimum and maximum value.

NOTE: Before you can add a Constraint to your Aspect Model, you have to add a Trait.

For more information on adding Traits, see xref:modeling/trait.adoc[].
