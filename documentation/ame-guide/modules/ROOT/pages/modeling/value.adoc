= Value

The Value type is designed to represent a value enriched with semantic metadata.
It encapsulates the actual data (which can be a literal or a reference) along with additional descriptive information.
This type is used to enhance clarity in Enumerations and Properties by allowing you to attach a human-readable label, a detailed description, and an external reference to the value.
