= Event

An Event is a model element that represents a single occurrence where the timing is important.
Assets can for instance emit events to notify other assets in case of special occurrences.

== Add an Event

To add an Event, proceed as follows:

* Open the Workspace sidebar
* Drag the Event element and drop it to the graph area canvas

== Connect the event with the Aspect
For a new model that only has an Aspect so far:

* Click the Event
* Right-click the Event to open the context menu
** Click the Connect with ...
** Select the Aspect element
** Confirm with Connect

→ As a result you have connected the Event with the Aspect.

Note that the details of such events — for example, which data (MQTT package) gets sent at which occurrence or time via an MQTT topic — are to be decided when implementing the event. +
The SAMM specification does not prescribe any defaults or rules. +
Thus, events can be adapted to your own implementation needs.
