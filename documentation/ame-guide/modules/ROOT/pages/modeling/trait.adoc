= Traits
[[trait-case]]

There are two ways of adding a Trait:

* Drag and drop one from the Workspace sidebar
* Click the top Add icon at a Characteristic

Clicking the top Add icon image:add.png[Add icon] of a Characteristic will add a new Trait, taking the Characteristic's position and connecting the Trait to the initial Characteristic as well as a newly created Constraint.
In this scenario, the newly created Trait takes the name of the parent attribute as a prefix to its own name.

A Trait has an Add icon image:add.png[Add icon] on the bottom of the element, which is always visible:

* When clicking the "Add" icon image:add.png[Add icon], a Characteristic is created and connected to the Trait.

* If there is already a Characteristic connected to the Trait, each Trait Add icon image:add.png[Add icon] click will create a new Constraint and connect it to the Trait.

=== Trait Example

Try out the following example to learn how to connect two Properties to the same Characteristic with each Property having different Constraints.

For a new model that only has an Aspect so far:

. Create two Properties by clicking twice on the Aspect's Add icon image:add.png[Add icon].
. For each Property create a Characteristic by clicking the top "Add" icon image:add.png[Add icon] of each Property.
. Click the top Add icon image:add.png[Add icon] of each Characteristic to create a Trait and a Constraint for each Property.
. Remove the second Characteristic.
. Connect the second Trait with the first Characteristic:
.. Click the Trait,
.. Then CTRL+click the Abstract Entity and click the Connect icon image:toolbar-icons/connect.png[Connect icon] on the xref:getting-started/ui-overview.adoc#toolbar[toolbar].
. Click the Format icon image:toolbar-icons/format.png[Format icon].

→ As a result you have connected two Properties to the same Characteristic with each Property having different Constraints.
