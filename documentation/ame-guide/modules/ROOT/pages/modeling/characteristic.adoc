= Characteristic

[[edit-characteristics]]
== Characteristic attributes

Depending on the *Characteristic class* (i.e., Characteristics' classes and instances), different attributes are available.
For the correct understanding of Characteristics, see https://eclipse-esmf.github.io/samm-specification/2.0.0/characteristics.html[Characteristics and Constraints (SAMM 2.0.0)^,opts=nofollow].
In the following, handling Characteristics with the Aspect Model Editor will be explained.

&nbsp;

[[choosing-characteristic-subclass]]
=== Choose a Characteristic class

For a new Characteristic, first choose a *Characteristic class* value from the drop-down menu of the Characteristic class attribute in the Edit dialog.

→ This will auto-populate the Edit dialog with the corresponding attribute fields.

&nbsp;


[[choose-correct-datatype]]
=== Data type attribute

SAMM allows two kinds of data types: simple types (scalars) and complex types (Entities).

* For using a *simple data type*, populate the data type field with a value like `xsd:float`,
`xsd:integer` or `xsd:string` (no quotation marks, no spaces), see https://eclipse-esmf.github.io/samm-specification/2.0.0/datatypes.html[Data Types (SAMM 2.0.0)^,opts=nofollow].
+
NOTE: Make sure that you do not include a space character as they are not accepted.

* For using a *complex data type*, relate this Characteristic with an Entity, which will then be the data type of the Characteristic.

&nbsp;

[[enumeration-characteristic]]
=== Enumeration Characteristics

An Enumeration Characteristic can have simple data types or complex data types.


[[characteristic-enumeration]]
==== Simple data types for Enumeration Characteristics

If your Characteristic is an Enumeration, provide the possible values as a space-separated list of strings, e.g., `red yellow green`.
See also https://eclipse-esmf.github.io/samm-specification/2.0.0/modeling-guidelines.html#declaring-enumerations[Declaring Enumerations(SAMM 2.0.0)^,opts=nofollow].

If no data type is selected, `string` is selected as default for the values.

[[characteristic-enumeration-complex-values]]
==== Complex data types for Enumeration Characteristics

If the Characteristic is an Enumeration and the data type is an Entity, the possible values for this enumeration are the instances of the provided Entity.

[[characteristic-structure-value]]
=== Structured Value Characteristics

Structured Value Characteristics allow to semantically describe formatted string-like values like a date, email, or product's type part number.
For example, for such type part numbers, the parts should be semantically described separately and the composition of those into one string should be described via a regular expression.
For more background on Structured Values, see https://eclipse-esmf.github.io/samm-specification/2.0.0/characteristics.html#structured-value-characteristic[Structured Value(SAMM 2.0.0)^,opts=nofollow]

For Structured Value Characteristics, the following attributes have to be defined:

[cols="30%,70%"]
|===
|_Deconstruction rule name_
|A single choice for choosing a predefined rule or defining a custom rule. image:structured-value-deconstruction-rule-name.png[Structured Value deconstruction rule name]
|_Deconstruction rule_
|

* If the `Custom Rule` is selected for the `Deconstruction rule name` attribute, this input option will be enabled and you can write your own rule.

* If anything else is selected, this attribute will be populated with a predefined rule and it is disabled.

* For a piece of your regex to correspond with a property in `samm-c:elements` it needs to be wrapped in round parentheses. This piece with round parentheses is called `capture group`.

image:structured-value-deconstruction-rule.png[Structured Value deconstruction rule]

|_Elements_
| Opens up a dialog containing a table with two columns. One column shows all the capture groups from the `Deconstruction rule` attribute and the second column allows to choose or create a Property for the corresponding capture group. image:structured-value-elements.png[Structured Value elements] image:structured-value-elements-dialog.png[Structured Value elements dialog]

|===

To edit a new Structured Value Characteristic, proceed as follows:

. In the xref:modeling/edit-elements.adoc#edit-elements-general[Edit dialog], choose the Characteristic class StructuredValue.

. Enter values for the attributes _Deconstruction rule name_, _Deconstruction rule_, and _Elements_.

. Click *Save*.

→ Now you can see the changes in editor.

To create a new element from such a Structured Value Characteristic, proceed as follows:

* Click the Add icon image:add.png[Add icon] on the Structured Value Characteristic shape.

→ As a result, a new Property is created.

NOTE: A new Property created from a Structured Value Characteristic, is automatically inserted as an attribute in the Structured Value Characteristic and the `(regex)` capture group is automatically appended to `deconstructionRule`.

[[choose-correct-unit]]
=== Unit as an attribute for Characteristics

As an attribute for Characteristics, a Unit can be optional or mandatory.

If your Characteristic is a *Quantifiable* (see https://eclipse-esmf.github.io/samm-specification/2.0.0/characteristics.html[Characteristics (SAMM 2.0.0)^,opts=nofollow]), Unit is an optional attribute (only exception for not having a Unit: unit-less countable Quantifiable).

For the Characteristic classes *Duration* and *Measurement* the Unit attribute is mandatory.

Entering a value to the Unit attribute field is done through a search:

* Start typing the Unit you are searching for.
* You may also use advanced search syntax (=metre, *metre, perSecond$) as explained in xref:getting-started/edit-models.adoc#searching-elements[Search Elements].
* Select your Unit from the drop-down menu of the Unit attribute.

For a complete list of supported Units refer to the https://eclipse-esmf.github.io/samm-specification/2.0.0/appendix/unitcatalog.html[Unit Catalog (SAMM 2.0.0)^,opts=nofollow].

Further explanations about using Units can be found in https://eclipse-esmf.github.io/samm-specification/2.0.0/characteristics.html[Characteristics (SAMM 2.0.0)^,opts=nofollow].

NOTE: Do not include space characters as they are not accepted.
