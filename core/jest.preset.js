   * By default Nx has kept the older style of Jest Snapshot formats
   * to prevent breaking of any existing tests with snapshots.
   * It's recommend you update to the latest format.
   * You can do this by removing snapshotFormat property
   * and running tests with --update-snapshot flag.
   * Example: "nx affected --targets=test --update-snapshot"
   * More info: https://jestjs.io/docs/upgrading-to-jest29#snapshot-format
