# utils

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

The library is intended for storing reusable general-purpose utils.

NOTE: It's recommended to use pure functions in order to make them tree-shakable.

## Building

Run `nx build utils` to build the library.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test utils` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
